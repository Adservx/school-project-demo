# Console Errors Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Fixed: manifest.json 401 Error
**Root Cause:** Vercel's old `routes` configuration wasn't properly serving static assets.

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated `vercel.json` to use modern `rewrites` instead of deprecated `routes`
- Added proper HTTP headers for `manifest.json` with correct `Content-Type: application/manifest+json`
- Added security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`)

**Files Modified:**
- `vercel.json` - Migrated from routes to rewrites with proper headers

### 2. ✅ Fixed: Gallery Image Path Issues
**Root Cause:** Image paths were URL-encoded when React handles encoding automatically.

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated gallery image paths in `src/utils/content.js` to use natural spaces
- React will automatically encode spaces to %20 when needed

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/content.js` - Updated `galleryImages` array paths

### 3. ✅ Fixed: Accessibility Console Warnings
**Root Cause:** Quote navigation dots were clickable spans without proper accessibility.

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed `<span>` elements to `<button>` elements for quote dots
- Added `aria-label` attributes for screen reader support
- Added `type="button"` to prevent form submission behavior
- Updated CSS to ensure button.dot styling matches original design

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Home.jsx` - Quote dots now use semantic HTML
- `src/components.css` - Added button reset styles for `.dot` class

## Deployment Steps

To apply these fixes to production:

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix manifest.json 401 error and console warnings"

# Push to Vercel
git push
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new configuration.

## Verification

After deployment, check:
1. ✅ No 401 error for manifest.json in browser console
2. ✅ No accessibility warnings for quote dots
3. ✅ Gallery images load correctly
4. ✅ PWA manifest loads properly for mobile installation

## Additional Notes

- The manifest.json fix requires redeployment to Vercel
- Local development (`npm start`) won't show the 401 error as it only occurs in production
- All changes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality
